When I ask for a PFreda, do this:

Defs

dp means "display"
fq means "frequency"
gm means "grapheme"
ip means "input"
rp means "replace"
rt means "root"
wt means "with"

1. Generate IPA for ip sample
2. For each gm that exists:
rp ʔ & ʡ wt ا
rp b & p wt ب
rp t wt ت
rp θ wt ث
rp ʒ wt ج
rp ħ wt ح
rp χ wt خ
rp d wt د
rp ð wt ذ
rp r & ʀ wt ر
rp z wt ز
rp s wt س
rp ʃ wt ش
rp sˤ wt ص
rp dˤ wt ض
rp tˤ wt ط
rp zˤ & ðˤ wt ظ
rp ʕ & ʢ wt ع
rp g & ɣ wt غ
rp f & v wt ف
rp q wt ق
rp k wt ك
rp l wt ل
rp m wt م
rp n wt ن
rp h wt ه
rp w wt و
rp j wt ي
add same no. of ن & g as in ŋ & remove all ŋ
add same no. of ت & ي as in ʧ & remove ʧ
3. Remove every non-Arabic gm
4. Count gm fq's. Descending order as <count>: <gm> 5. Display as plain text list: not in code window
6. Remove non-consonants
7 Sort every fq group into ascending alpha order
8. Display consonant gm's as space-separated string. No repeats
9. Cycle thru string, shifting 1 gm at a time.  Read 3 gms at a time Sort gm's selected into alpha order
10. Check web for each gm trigram in online Arabic lexica; if found, record meanings. If not, note immediate rts on either side of that hypothetical rt.
11. Gather all rt meanings, including adjacent ones, to identify themes. Only use adjacent rts where target rt invalid.
12. Compare rt meanings to ip's context & note cl's. Output only summary conclusion on how meanings fit ip & explanation of cl to the ip's context, if context provided. Include cl % score of results to ip material.

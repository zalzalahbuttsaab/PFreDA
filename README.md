# PFreDA
Phonetic Frequency Distribution Analysis code: determining underlying sentiment in any language or none

So here are the basic instructions of how to use the code:

Cut and paste these instructions into a new session. ChatGPT will respond. Type, PFREDA followed by the words someone has said or texted to you or any written text in any language, e.g.,

PFreDA "Mary had a little lamb. It's fleece was white as snow. And everywhere that Mary went the lamb was sure to go"

and hit the send key. ChatGPT will then analyse the text and pull out any underlying meanings.

Copy and paste the code into the custom instructions section and then follow the instructions as above.

there are some caveats: this is a new technology so there may be teething issues that require a little technical knowledge that i myself have. This is because the LLM is not designed for high tech precision applications. Having said this and having field tested the system, I am happy to release it far and wide to everyone as quickly as possible. I feel also that the underlying paradigm is sufficiently robust to accommodate the foilables inherent in the transport technology, i.e., the LLM. To this end, take the results with soke caution and i accept no liability for any end use including incorporation into any device, mobile or otherwise. 

Objective use

The code will generate a string of Arabic letters, which I refer to as an "ident": these are the graphemes ("letters") found in the text provided for analysis and are sorted according to the total frequency each one occurs in the text and within that, according to increasing alpha order. As you will have provided the system with some context already, based on the original text you supplied, the system will try to understand the themes it extracts from the text based on the context of the text as best it can. This usually leads to the results having a high correlation with the input text. This is normal but to get an objective and truer sense of the themes extracted, i.e., without context, take the ident from the first analysis, open a new session (pasting the code as the first prompt if you dont have a paid account) and typing

PFREDA ا ب غ و ك ي س ث م ج

where the you would put the ident you generated instead of the ident here. And that will make the system give a more objective summary based on the themes extracted, along with a correlation score. Once you have the objective summary, paste in the original text from the previous session and tell ChatGPT that this was the original context, and ChatGPT will again provide a subjective summary and may increase the first correlation score now it has more context. You can also add more context to this and ChatGPT will respond accordingly.
